        "why we do Eda in project?\n",
        "Ans:Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is important in machine learning because it helps ensure that the data used for modeling is accurate and representative of the real world:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Detects outliers:** Machine learning algorithms are sensitive to the range and distribution of features, so it's important to identify and remove outliers that could affect the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Validates theories:** EDA helps validate theories through in-depth data analysis.\n",
        "**Identifies patterns:** EDA helps identify patterns in the data that might not be obvious.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Checks correlation:** Before building a model, it's important to check the correlation between the independent and dependent variables.\n",
